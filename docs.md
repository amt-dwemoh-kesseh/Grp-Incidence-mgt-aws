# Technical Documentation – City Monitoring & Reporting Platform Implementation

## 1. Overview

The **City Monitoring & Reporting Platform** provides real-time monitoring and analytics of incidents reported within different regions and districts. The system leverages **AWS Serverless architecture** to ensure scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of management. The solution integrates data ingestion, processing, storage, analytics, and visualization using AWS services such as **DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, SQS, Step Functions, and QuickSight**.

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1 Authentication

* **Amazon Cognito** manages user authentication and authorization.
* Provides secure signup, login, and identity federation.

### 2.2 Data Ingestion

* **API Gateway + Lambda**: Exposes REST/GraphQL endpoints for incident reporting.
* Incidents are validated and written to **DynamoDB (IncidentTable)**.
* DynamoDB **Streams** capture changes for downstream processing.

### 2.3 Data Storage

* **DynamoDB**: Stores incident reports with GSIs to optimize queries.
* **S3 Data Lake**: Stores transformed data (CSV/Parquet) for analytics.
* Data lifecycle managed with **S3 bucket policies** and **lifecycle rules**.

### 2.4 Data Processing

* **Lambda Functions**:

  * Stream processors (from DynamoDB Streams) extract & transform records.
  * Periodic batch jobs export aggregated data to S3.
* **AWS Step Functions** orchestrate periodic exports to ensure reliability.
* **Amazon SQS** buffers processing jobs for fault tolerance.

### 2.5 Analytics & Visualization

* **Amazon QuickSight** connects to S3 as a data source.
* Dashboards provide real-time statistics:

  * Incident counts by **region** & **district**.
  * Incidents categorized by **status** and **category**.
  * User-level reporting.

### 2.6 Notifications

* **Amazon SNS** sends alerts for critical incidents (e.g., by severity).

## 3. DynamoDB Table Design

**IncidentTable** with GSIs supports queries:

* By **Region + Status**
* By **Region + Category**
* By **District + Status**
* By **District + Category**
* By **ReportedBy (User)**

---

## 4. Data Export Workflow

1. DynamoDB Streams trigger a **Lambda processor**.
2. Lambda extracts incident data, transforms it, and batches records.
3. Data is periodically written to **S3 bucket** in CSV/Parquet format.
4. **QuickSight** reads from S3 and updates the dashboard automatically.

---

## 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Implemented via **AWS SAM/CloudFormation**.
* Provisions:

  * DynamoDB tables with GSIs.
  * S3 buckets for analytics data.
  * Lambda functions & roles.
  * Step Functions for orchestration.
  * QuickSight permissions and dataset integration.

---

## 6. Security & Compliance

* **IAM least privilege** for all Lambda, S3, and QuickSight roles.
* **Encryption**:

  * DynamoDB with AES-256 SSE.
  * S3 with SSE-S3.
* **VPC Endpoints** for private data transfer.
* **CloudWatch Logs** for auditing.

---

## 7. Deployment Strategy

* CI/CD with **AWS CodePipeline** and **CodeBuild**.
* Automated deployments of Lambda & IaC.
* Separate environments for **Dev, Staging, and Production**.

---

## 8. Monitoring & Observability

* **CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms** for Lambda execution errors and DynamoDB throttling.
* **CloudTrail** for API auditing.

---

## 9. Cost Optimization

* **DynamoDB PAY\_PER\_REQUEST** billing mode.
* **S3 Lifecycle Rules** to transition old data to Glacier.
* **QuickSight Standard Edition** for cost-effective dashboards.
* Lambda functions optimized with memory/runtime profiling.

---

## 10. Future Enhancements

* Real-time streaming with **Kinesis Data Streams**.
* ML-based anomaly detection for incidents.
* Integration with **Open Data APIs** for external reporting.

---

✅ This architecture ensures **real-time reporting**, **efficient analytics**, and **public dashboards**, while remaining **secure, scalable, and cost-effective**.
